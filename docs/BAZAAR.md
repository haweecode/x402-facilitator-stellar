# Bazaar Data Model

## Identity Decision
Identity is the crucial decision for the catalog:
- **HTTP resources** are keyed uniquely by their `url`.
- **MCP resources** are keyed by the tuple `(url, toolName)` because a single MCP server URL can expose multiple tools, and each tool is considered a distinct catalog entry.

## Upstream Type
Derived from `@x402/extensions` (v2.21.0) `DiscoveryResource`.

## API: `GET /discovery/resources`

Allows agents and clients to list discovered resources with optional filtering and pagination.
Pagination uses `limit` (max 100, default 20) and `offset`. The results are ordered by discovery time (newest first).

### Example
```bash
curl "https://facilitator.example.com/discovery/resources?type=mcp&limit=10"
```
```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "mcp",
      "url": "http://mcp.ex",
      "toolName": "search_docs",
      "serviceName": "Documentation Search",
      "scheme": "exact",
      "network": "stellar:testnet"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "limit": 10,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

## API: `GET /discovery/resource`

Reads a **single** entry, keyed by its URL — the point lookup behind the listing (#222). A caller who already knows the URL does not have to page the whole catalog to find it. Pass `toolName` to disambiguate two tools sharing one MCP server URL.

Unauthenticated, like the other discovery reads. A missing `url` is a `400`; an unknown `url` is a `404` with reason `resource_not_found`, deliberately sent **without** cache headers — a cached "does not exist" would outlive the seller's registration and keep every reader misinformed for the whole max-age.

### Example
```bash
curl "https://facilitator.example.com/discovery/resource?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmcp.ex&toolName=search_docs"
```
```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "resource": {
    "type": "mcp",
    "url": "http://mcp.ex",
    "toolName": "search_docs",
    "serviceName": "Documentation Search",
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "stellar:testnet"
  }
}
```

## API: `DELETE /discovery/resource`

Removes a listing outright (#221). Before this the catalog was append-only in practice: `pruneExpired` only ever hid verify-created provisional entries, and only until the next verify re-registered them.

The removal is not a hide. The entry, its per-`payTo` accounting and its embedding all go, so a later `/verify` re-creates it as a fresh provisional listing rather than resurrecting the old one. The deletion is by exact key and does **not** consult the public-view filter, so an expired-but-not-yet-pruned entry — invisible to every read, yet still occupying its key — can still be removed by the only route that can name it.

Authenticated and metered against the catalog-write bucket like `POST /discovery/resources`, and audited as `catalog_delete`. **Deletion is not scoped to the caller**: nothing in this service maps an API key to a `payTo`, so there is no ownership to enforce and pretending otherwise would be a check that always passes. Any valid key may remove any listing; the audit event records who did.

```bash
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  "https://facilitator.example.com/discovery/resource?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.ex%2Fpaid"
```
```json
{ "ok": true, "removed": { "url": "http://api.ex/paid", "toolName": null } }
```

A `404` with reason `resource_not_found` means nothing matched — the route does not report a removal that did not happen.

## API: `GET /discovery/search`

Provides search over discovered resources, designed to be called by agents discovering tools on the fly. It takes a natural-language `query` (§3.2), with `limit`/`cursor` pagination and a `partialResults` flag.

### Spec Conformance: `cursor` and `partialResults`

Both are named §3.2 requirements, so their behaviour is pinned by tests (`test/catalog.search.test.js` at the store level, `test/search.http.test.js` at the wire level):

- **`cursor`** is an opaque, base64-encoded string encoding a rank offset (`offset:N`). Like `limit`, it is *advisory* — the server may return fewer results than the page size, and `pagination.cursor` is `null` when there is no next page. An invalid cursor is ignored (treated as page one). Iterating pages with the returned cursor yields each catalog entry exactly once, in stable rank order.
- **`partialResults`** is `true` whenever the result set may be incomplete: when no embeddings provider is configured (the lexical leg is complete, the semantic leg is absent), when the embeddings provider is configured but does not answer, or when any resource in the catalog has no embedding yet (it failed or was never re-embedded). It is `false` only when every retrieval leg that was configured actually ran over every candidate. It is a signal to the agent that the top-N may not be the true top-N, not an error.

### The Ranking Model

Ranking is a weighted lexical score, optionally fused with a dense-embedding leg and reranked when a provider is configured. The lexical weights are in `src/catalog/search.js`; this section is the written model a reviewer can hold against them.

For each whitespace-separated, lowercased token of the query, against each candidate resource:

| Signal | Where | Weight | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `serviceName` contains the token | `serviceName` | **+10** | The name is the seller's own short description of the tool. A token in it is the strongest evidence of intent match, so it dominates — deliberately more than any other single signal. |
| `tags` contains the token exactly | `tags[]` | **+8** | An exact tag is a controlled vocabulary match — the seller explicitly classified the resource that way. |
| `tags` partially contains the token | `tags[]` | **+4** | Partial tag match (e.g. `weather` in `weather-api`) is weaker evidence but still useful; half the exact-tag weight. |
| `description` contains the token | `description` | **+3** | Free text is where most content lives, but it is also where keyword-stuffing lands, so it is weighted well below name and tags. |
| `extensions` JSON contains the token | `extensions` (serialized) | **+1** | Parameter descriptions inside the discovery extension are critical for an agent calling the tool, but they are the most remote from intent — a token there alone is weak evidence. |
| Provenance boost | `source === 'payment'` | **+5** | Resources that arrived off a real payment outrank manually-registered ones. See the integrity caveat below — this boost is only as trustworthy as the claim that a payment proves ownership. |

Notes on the model:

- **Scores are additive across tokens.** A multi-token query that hits several signals on one resource accumulates them, which is what lets a phrase like "latitude longitude climate" surface the weather API through its parameter descriptions even though those tokens are nowhere in the name.
- **The boost applies only to lexical matches.** `if (score === 0) return 0` runs before the `+5`, so a payment-verified resource that matches nothing lexically cannot win a query on provenance alone — provenance re-ranks among candidates, it does not conjure them.
- **Decay applies to the whole score, boost included.** The `+5` is added before decay, so an old verified listing decays like any other old listing; verification slows decay's *relative* effect but does not exempt the resource from it.

#### Time decay

Scores decay exponentially with age:

```
score' = score × e^(−daysOld / 43)
```

`43` is the decay constant; the **half-life is ≈ 30 days** (e^(−30/43) ≈ 0.50). The reasoning: a paid resource that stops being reachable is discovered by agents re-verifying it, and a month is a reasonable upper bound on "the endpoint that worked last week still works" for the long tail of a catalog. Something 30 days stale keeps half its rank, something 90 days stale keeps ~12% — it falls, but does not vanish, so agents can still find dormant-but-real tools while fresh ones float to the top. Decay applies only when `daysOld > 0`; a resource with no `last_seen_at` is treated as fresh.

Why exponential rather than a step function: a step (e.g. "drop everything older than N days") creates cliff-edge churn — a resource that is 30 days + 1 second old vanishes from page one entirely. Exponential decay is smooth, so ranking degrades continuously and a single re-verification (`upsertResource`) restores freshness.

#### Hybrid leg (configured only)

When `EMBEDDINGS_URL` is set, a dense leg runs alongside the lexical one: the query and each resource are embedded, cosine similarity is computed, and the two ranked lists are fused with **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** (`k = 60`). When `ENABLE_RERANKING=true`, the fused top page is passed through a reranker. With no provider configured (the memory-backed default), the lexical leg alone decides order and `partialResults` is reported `true` — see above.

**Embedding model changes:** embedding responses are validated (non-empty array of finite numbers). The dimension of the first accepted vector is recorded; a later vector with a different length is rejected with an explicit error log — it means the embedding model or provider changed and the index must be rebuilt (see the re-index procedure at the end of this file). An operator changing the model should re-index rather than letting stored vectors silently mismatch every query vector.

**A vector describes the text it was computed from, and nothing else (#220).** A re-cataloguing upsert builds the new entry on top of the existing one, so it inherits the previous vector. When the new content composes to different text, that vector is no longer a description of the resource, and the dense leg would go on ranking it by content that no longer exists — silently, because a failed re-embed only logs a warning.

So the stale vector is dropped **synchronously**, before the embed is attempted. While the new vector is being computed the resource ranks lexically (honest) rather than densely against the wrong document (confident and wrong), and if the re-embed then fails the drop has already happened and stays. Each vector carries a fingerprint of the text it was computed from; an upsert whose text is unchanged keeps its vector and skips the embed entirely, so a verify re-touching an already-listed resource costs no provider call.

The fingerprint is a change *detector*, not a security measure — a non-cryptographic 64-bit hash (FNV-1a over two lanes), sufficient to tell whether the attached vector still describes the entry, and collision-resistant enough that two genuinely different listings do not share one.

#### Integrity caveat: the `+5` verified boost

The boost is only meaningful if "verified" means something. Two properties of the current design weaken it, tracked separately:

- **Cataloguing happens on `/verify` as well as `/settle`** — a listing costs nothing to obtain, so `source: 'payment'` can be true without any settlement having occurred ([#140](https://github.com/accensa/x402-facilitator-stellar/issues/140)).
- **Nothing binds a listing to the URL it claims to own** — first writer wins, and later writes upsert over it, so a third party can list a URL they do not control and describe it however ranks best ([#151](https://github.com/accensa/x402-facilitator-stellar/issues/151); the narrower URL-scheme gap is [#236](https://github.com/accensa/x402-facilitator-stellar/issues/236)).

Until those are resolved, the `+5` is an honest-but-weak signal: it says "a payment payload named this resource", not "the party that controls this URL confirmed it". The ranking model keeps the boost because a settled-listing *does* outrank a never-touched one in the common case, but a reviewer should read it as provenance, not proof. The spoofing fix in #151 should decide whether the boost survives as-is.

### Cold Start
Because ranking over an empty catalog is meaningless, the memory store relies on the testnet and pubnet instances being seeded with a curated set of example tools on startup (or via `POST /discovery/resources` in CI pipelines) to provide immediate utility for first-time callers.

### Pagination & Degraded States
Cursor pagination is implemented via the opaque `cursor` parameter (base64 `offset:N`). Both `limit` and `cursor` are *advisory* — the server may return fewer results. `partialResults` is set to `true` whenever any configured retrieval leg did not run over every candidate — no embeddings provider configured, provider unreachable, or a resource not yet embedded — and is `false` only when every configured leg completed. See "Spec Conformance" above for the pinned behaviour.

### Performance Target
The p95 latency target for this endpoint is **<50ms**, ensuring it does not block agent interactive paths.

### Result Caching (#392)
Discovery traffic is repetitive — agents poll the same handful of queries — so results are cached in two tiers when `CATALOG_SEARCH_CACHE=1`: an in-process LRU (5s) in front of a shared Redis entry (60s). This is where the Postgres saving comes from; N replicas issue one query per distinct query rather than N. See `.env.example` for the flag and `docs/OPERATIONS.md` for the `x402_catalog_cache_lookups_total` series.

Caching does not weaken the freshness contract. The catalog's monotonic write version is part of the cache key, so any write makes every earlier entry unreachable immediately — no cached read can be stale, and that holds even if an invalidation message is lost. A write publishes on a Redis channel so other replicas drop their L1 immediately instead of on their next miss. Concurrent misses for the same key collapse into one catalog query, so the L1 expiry window is not also a stampede window. If Redis is unreachable the cache is bypassed and the catalog is queried directly: a cache outage can slow discovery down but cannot fail it. Responses are byte-identical to an uncached read; the cache is not observable to a client.

## Validation & Cataloging Policy

Automatic cataloging is triggered asynchronously off the payment path for `/verify` and `/settle` when the `PaymentPayload` carries the discovery extension. Manual registration is supported via `POST /discovery/resources` but marked as `source: 'manual'`.

The validation rules for resources submitted to the catalog are as follows:

| Field | Failure | Outcome | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Extension schema | Invalid | **Hard drop** (resource discarded) | Must conform to upstream bazaar spec. |
| `routeTemplate` | Traversal / protocol smuggling / unparseable | **Hard drop** (resource discarded) | Security boundary to prevent SSRF and traversal. |
| `routeTemplate` | Malformed but not hostile (e.g. a bare wildcard `*`) | **Soft drop** (field removed, resource still lands) | Upstream's own SDK registers a wildcard route by default and warns it degrades to auto-generated parameter names — a seller on stock defaults should not silently vanish from discovery. See #65. |
| `serviceName` | Invalid / Oversized | **Soft drop** (field removed) | Protects against UI bloat and poisoning. |
| `iconUrl` | Invalid or private IP | **Soft drop** (field removed) | Protects against SSRF tracking pixels and local probes. |
| `description` | Contains HTML or oversized | **Truncated** (up to 200 chars) | Prevents script injection and limits storage impact. |
| `tags` | Too many tags or oversized | **Filtered** (invalid tags dropped) | Prevents tag flooding and index bloat. |

**Catalog limits:**
- **Rate Limit:** Catalog operations are limited per payer IP to 10 requests per minute (`catalog_rpm` in config).
- **Resource Cap:** A single `payTo` address can have a maximum of 50 resources in the catalog (configurable via `CATALOG_MAX_RESOURCES_PER_PAYTO`). New inserts beyond this limit are rejected with the stable reason code `maximum_resources_per_payto_exceeded` — the same code on both the manual (`POST /discovery/resources`) and payment-cataloging paths.
- **Overall Size Limit:** The catalog has a maximum size of 10,000 total resources (configurable via `CATALOG_MAX_SIZE`). New inserts beyond this limit are rejected with the stable reason code `maximum_catalog_size_exceeded`.
- **PayTo changes:** If a resource is already cataloged and a subsequent payment reports a different `payTo`, a warning is logged.

## The `EXTENSION-RESPONSES` Header

Every successful `/verify` (valid payment) and `/settle` (settled payment)
response tells the seller what the Bazaar did with the resource declared in
the payment:

```
EXTENSION-RESPONSES: <base64>
```

The value is the base64 encoding of a JSON object with a single `bazaar`
key — the **envelope**:

```json
{
  "bazaar": {
    "status": "<status>",
    "code": "<code>",
    "reason": "<explanation>"
  }
}
```

`code` and `reason` are present only for the statuses that carry them. Decode
it from a shell with a one-liner:

```bash
curl -si <paid-request> | grep -i extension-responses | cut -d' ' -f2 | base64 -d | jq
```

or in Node:

```js
const header = response.headers.get('extension-responses');
const outcome = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(header, 'base64').toString('utf8'));
```

### Worked example

A listing that landed:

```
EXTENSION-RESPONSES: eyJiYXphYXIiOnsic3RhdHVzIjoibGFuZGVkIiwiY29kZSI6ImNhdGFsb2dfc3VjY2VzcyJ9fQ==
```

decodes to:

```json
{
  "bazaar": {
    "status": "landed",
    "code": "catalog_success"
  }
}
```

And one that was rejected because the route template was hostile:

```
EXTENSION-RESPONSES: eyJiYXphYXIiOnsic3RhdHVzIjoicmVqZWN0ZWQiLCJjb2RlIjoiaW52YWxpZF9yb3V0ZVRlbXBsYXRlIn19
```

decodes to:

```json
{
  "bazaar": {
    "status": "rejected",
    "code": "invalid_routeTemplate"
  }
}
```

### Outcomes

| `status` | Meaning | `code` | `reason` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `not attempted` | The payment carried no usable Bazaar discovery extension, so nothing was cataloged. Not an error — the seller simply did not declare discovery metadata. | — | — |
| `landed` | The resource was cataloged and is discoverable. | `catalog_success` | — |
| `partially landed` | The resource was cataloged, but one or more fields were dropped for quality. | `catalog_partial` | `Dropped fields: <field, ...>` |
| `rejected` | The resource was **not** cataloged. | one of the codes below | Set for rate-limit rejections |

### Every code a seller can receive

| `code` | Status | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `catalog_success` | `landed` | The listing is live. | Nothing. |
| `catalog_partial` | `partially landed` | The listing is live but fields were dropped; `reason` names them. | Fix the named fields (table below) and make a fresh payment — cataloging runs off the payment path and will upsert the corrected listing. |
| `catalog_rate_limited` | `rejected` | Cataloging is metered per caller (default 10/min, `catalog_rpm` via `RATE_LIMIT_GLOBAL`). The payment itself still succeeded — only the cataloging was skipped. | Wait a minute, or raise `catalog_rpm` in the operator's config. |
| `invalid_declaration` | `rejected` | The declaration was not an object at all — the cataloging path received a null, a string, or a primitive where a discovery declaration was expected. | Send a JSON object shaped like the Seller Guide's example; validate offline with `npx validate-discovery metadata.json` before paying again. |
| `invalid_extension_schema` | `rejected` | The `bazaar` extension in the payment payload does not conform to the upstream spec. | Validate offline with `npx validate-discovery metadata.json` and fix the extension shape, then pay again. |
| `invalid_pricing_amount` | `rejected` | The `pricing.amount` field is not a valid decimal numeric string (e.g., contains letters, exponent notation, or is a number type). | Use a decimal string like `"1.5"` or `"0.0000001"`; numbers lose precision before stroop conversion and are rejected. |
| `invalid_routeTemplate` | `rejected` | The `routeTemplate` is hostile: path traversal (`..`), protocol smuggling (`://`), or unparseable percent-encoding. This is a security boundary, not a quality nit. | Use a plain path template such as `/api/resource/{id}` and pay again. |
| `invalid_url_scheme` | `rejected` | The resource URL uses a scheme other than `http` or `https`. | Change the resource URL to use a standard web protocol (`https` recommended) and pay again. |
| `invalid_url` | `rejected` | The resource URL could not be parsed as a valid URL. | Fix the formatting of the resource URL and pay again. |
| `maximum_catalog_size_exceeded` | `rejected` | The catalog has reached its maximum size limit (default 10,000 resources). | Contact the operator to increase `CATALOG_MAX_SIZE` or prune expired entries. |
| `maximum_resources_per_payto_exceeded` | `rejected` | A single `payTo` address has reached its maximum resource limit (default 50 resources). | Contact the operator to increase `CATALOG_MAX_RESOURCES_PER_PAYTO` or remove old listings. |
| `missing_or_invalid_discovery_extension` | `not attempted` | No Bazaar discovery extension could be found or extracted from the payment. | If you want to be listed, declare discovery metadata (see the [Seller Guide](SELLER.md)); otherwise nothing to fix. |

### Soft-dropped fields (`catalog_partial`)

When the status is `partially landed`, the `reason` reads
`Dropped fields: <field, ...>`; each named field was removed from an otherwise
live listing:

| Field in `reason` | What was dropped | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `routeTemplate` | A wildcard or malformed-but-not-hostile template (e.g. the bare `*` the stock SDK registers by default). | Provide a concrete template with named parameters. |
| `serviceName` | Invalid or oversized service name. | A short, plain-text name. |
| `iconUrl` | Invalid or private-IP URL. | A public HTTPS icon URL. |
| `description` | The description contained markup (a tag, or an entity-encoded one such as `&lt;script&gt;`). See [why refusal replaces sanitising](#why-a-description-with-markup-is-refused-not-sanitised). | Plain text, no HTML and no HTML entities. |
| `tags_filtered` | Invalid or oversized tags were dropped. | Fewer, well-formed tags. |

#### Why a description with markup is refused, not sanitised

The catalog used to strip tags with a regex and keep what survived. That is a
sanitiser, and a regex cannot be a security boundary:

- `<scr<script>ipt>` strips to `<script>` — the filter manufactures the tag it
  was meant to remove.
- `&lt;script&gt;` is not matched at all, and is markup to every consumer that
  entity-decodes.
- `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)` with no closing `>` was swallowed silently by
  the pattern's optional tail, so the seller was never told anything had been
  removed.

A description is prose. Refusing a value that needs angle brackets to say what
it means is the only policy that holds, so the field is dropped and the rest of
the listing still lands (`partially landed`). Plain prose is unaffected — a
bare `&`, as in "Weather & tides", is not markup and is kept.

### Truncated fields (reported separately from drops)

A field the catalog **stored, shortened** is not a dropped field, and reporting
it as one was wrong on the wire (#219): `reason` would read
`Dropped fields: description_truncated`, sending a seller to look for a field
that was still in the catalog — and naming a field that does not exist.

Truncations travel in a separate `truncated` array on the envelope instead, and
also leave the status at `partially landed`:

```json
{ "bazaar": { "status": "partially landed", "code": "catalog_partial",
              "reason": "Truncated fields: description",
              "truncated": ["description"] } }
```

| Field in `truncated` | What happened | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | Kept, but cut to the 200-character index limit. The cut never splits an astral character, so the stored value is always valid UTF-16. | Keep descriptions under 200 characters. |

`POST /discovery/resources` reports both lists separately in its response body
(`softDrops` and `truncations`).

The codes above are extracted from `src/catalog/validation.js` and
`src/app.js`, and `test/extension-responses-doc.test.js` fails if a code is
added to the cataloging path without being documented here.

### Header size

The envelope is encoded into the `EXTENSION-RESPONSES` response header, which
is bounded (#202). The value is base64 of the JSON, so it is 4/3 the size of
the JSON plus the envelope, and every hop in the request path caps headers:
nginx to 8 KiB by default, Envoy to 60 KiB, common HTTP/2 stacks to 16 KiB. A
header over the cap does not arrive truncated — the proxy answers **502** or
drops the connection, on the payment path, for a payment that has already
settled. The buyer's money moves and the response explaining it never arrives.

So the header is capped at **4096 bytes** and degrades in tiers rather than
failing:

| Tier | When | What the client receives |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The envelope fits. | The envelope exactly as described above — byte-for-byte what an unbounded encoder would have produced. |
| 2 | It does not fit. | The same envelope with `reason` removed and `"detail_omitted": true` added. |
| 3 | It still does not fit (a non-`reason` field was enormous). | `{ "status": ..., "code": "extension_response_omitted", "detail_omitted": true }`. |

The `status` is preserved in every tier: a client learning `rejected` without
learning why is a far better outcome than a client learning nothing. Every
degradation is logged server-side, so an operator can see that detail was shed.

## Search Quality & Evaluation History

### What `eval/` measures

`npm run eval` (`eval/runner.js`) measures how well the search ranking satisfies real agent intents, end to end through the store's `search()` path. It:

1. Loads a fixed fixture catalog (`eval/fixtures/catalog.json`) into an in-memory store, with artificial `last_seen_at` ages so the decay term is exercised.
2. Runs every query in the human-authored judgement set (`eval/judgements/queries.json`) through `search()` with a mock embeddings provider, so the hybrid leg (embedding + reranking) is exercised deterministically.
3. Scores the returned ranking against graded relevance judgements and reports per-query and aggregate metrics.

The judgement set is deliberately adversarial, not flattering: it includes a keyword-stuffed spam listing (`api.poison.example`) that must *not* rank, a stale legacy listing that must rank but not dominate, a query that only matches via parameter descriptions inside `extensions`, and an empty-result case.

### How judgements are produced

Each judgement is a query, a description of the agent intent behind it, and a relevance grade (0–3) for each fixture URL the query could plausibly return:

- `3` — exactly what the user wants
- `2` — solves the problem, imperfectly
- `1` — marginally relevant
- `0` — irrelevant, or actively harmful (keyword-stuffed)

Judgements are written by humans against the *fixed* fixture catalog, before (and independently of) tuning the weights. The process and contribution guide are in `eval/judgements/README.md`.

### Metrics reported

- **P@3** — precision in the top 3: relevant results / 3.
- **R@3** — recall in the top 3: relevant results found / total relevant in the fixture set.
- **MRR** — mean reciprocal rank: 1 / rank of the first relevant result, averaged over queries.
- **nDCG** — normalized discounted cumulative gain over the top 3, computed against the graded judgements (relevance 0–3), so a result ranked 1 that should be 3 costs more than one that should be 1.

### What counts as a regression

The runner gates merges on two aggregate thresholds, enforced in CI on every relevant change (`eval` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`):

- **nDCG ≥ 0.85**
- **MRR ≥ 0.8**

A change that moves either below its threshold fails CI. P@3 and R@3 are reported but not gated; they are noisier at this fixture size and are watched rather than enforced.

### Current scores (committed baseline)

Scores are committed here so movement is visible over time rather than asserted. Reproduce with `npm run eval`.

| Release | Date | P@3 | R@3 | MRR | nDCG | Notes |
|---------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|-------|
| `v0.0.1` | 2026-08-12 | 0.625 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 0.991 | Initial lexical baseline release |
| `v0.0.2` | 2026-08-12 | 0.583 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | Hybrid semantic search via API |
| `v0.0.3` | 2026-08-26 | 0.583 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1.000 | Baseline reproduced under the documented methodology (issue #153) — no algorithm change |

### Maintenance plan

Search quality is a maintained property, not a one-time measurement:

- **Who re-runs it:** CI runs `npm run eval` on every push and pull request. A contributor changing retrieval or ranking runs it locally before opening the PR.
- **How the judgement set grows:** additions to `eval/judgements/queries.json` are accepted even when they make current scores drop — accuracy of measurement outranks a high score. The contribution guide in `eval/judgements/README.md` names the cases most wanted: realistic agent queries, empty-result cases, and adversarial keyword-stuffed listings.
- **When to re-baseline:** any change to the ranking algorithm, the fixture catalog, or the embeddings/reranking wiring requires a fresh `npm run eval` and a new row in the scores table above. If the aggregate metrics move materially, the change ships with the new numbers and the reasoning, not with a hand-waved "should be fine".
- **Known limitation:** the fixture catalog is small and human-curated, and the embeddings provider in the harness is a keyword mock, so absolute numbers are directional, not a guarantee about the live catalog. See `eval/judgements/README.md` for the full limitation list.

## Full Re-index Procedure

Because this is an in-memory conformance spike, re-indexing is implicit on restart. All catalog items are rebuilt as payments arrive.

For a persistent deployment, a full re-index (required when changing the embedding model) is performed by:
1. Configuring the new embedding model endpoint.
2. Iterating through the primary catalog table.
3. Repopulating the dense vectors.
4. Hot-swapping the new vector index.
